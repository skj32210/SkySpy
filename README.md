# SkySpy

SkySpy is a weather application built with React that provides current weather information and a 7-day forecast for any location. It uses the Open-Meteo API for weather data and the Nominatim API for geocoding.

## Features

- Current weather information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
- 7-day weather forecast with daily high and low temperatures.
- Search for weather information by city name.
- Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.
- Dark mode and light mode themes based on user preference.


### Key Files

- **`public/index.html`**: The main HTML file that includes the root div where the React app is rendered.
- **`src/index.js`**: The entry point of the React application. It renders the `App` component.
- **`src/App.js`**: The main component of the application. It contains the logic for fetching weather data, handling user input, and rendering the UI.
- **`src/App.css`**: The CSS file for styling the application, including themes and responsive design.
- **`src/reportWebVitals.js`**: A utility for measuring performance in the app.
- **`src/setupTests.js`**: Configuration for setting up tests with Jest and React Testing Library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/skyspy.git
    cd skyspy

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
